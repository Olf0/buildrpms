Name:           buildrpms
Summary:        Script for building RPM packages from tar archives
# The Git release tag format shall adhere to just <version>.
# The <version> field adheres to semantic versioning and the <release> field 
# is comprised of {alpha,beta,rc,release} postfixed with a natural number
# greater or equal to 1 (e.g., "beta3") and may additonally be postfixed with a
# plus character ("+"), the name of the packager and a release number chosen by
# her (e.g., "rc2+jane4").  `{alpha|beta|rc|release}` indicates the expected
# status of the software.  No other identifiers shall be used for any published
# version, but for the purpose of testing infrastructure other nonsensical
# identifiers as `adud` may be used, which do *not* trigger a build at GitHub
# and OBS, when configured accordingly; mind the sorting (`adud` < `alpha`).
# For details and reasons, see
# https://github.com/Olf0/sfos-upgrade/wiki/Git-tag-format
Version:        0.9.0
Release:        beta1
# The Group tag should comprise one of the groups listed here:

# The "Source0:" line below requires that the value of %%{name} is also the
# project name at GitHub and the value of %%{version} is also the name of a
# correspondingly set git-tag.
Source0:        %{url}/archive/%{version}/%{name}-%{version}.tar.gz

%description
`buildrpms` takes a list of paths to tar archives, both files and
directories.  For directories the whole tree below is searched for valid
archives, for paths without slashes, the directories . and ~/Download.  The
archive paths may either contain shell type wildcards or be truncated
(without unquoted wildcards).
    
`buildrpms` currently recognises the mutually exclusive options "-?|--help",
"-i|--in-place", "-n|--no-move" and "-d|--debug".  By default `buildrpms`
extracts the spec file of each archive found, processes it and moves each
valid archive to the ./SOURCES directory; "-n|--no-move" links each valid
archive in ./SOURCES instead of moving.  "-i|--in-place" omits extracting and
processing of spec files and directly uses the archives at their original
location.
